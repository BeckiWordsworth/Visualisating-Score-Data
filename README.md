# Alva Case

This is a boilerplate repository for a programming case. 

## Technical overview
The boilerplate code is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

You will use our mock-api for the case. The API is written in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

We use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) as a GraphQL client. There is an [example in the repository](https://github.com/alvalabs/case/tree/master/src/containers/WithOrganization) of how to use [React Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-apollo.html) .

You need a token to use the API. We will give you a token that you need to place in the [config file](https://github.com/alvalabs/case/blob/master/src/config.js).

## Get started
1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:alvalabs/case.git`

2. Run `npm install` to install required packages.

3. Insert the token you have received in the config file.

4. Start the application with `npm start`

5. Start coding!
